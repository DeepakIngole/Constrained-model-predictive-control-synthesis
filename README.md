# Constrained-model-predictive-control-synthesis

Constrained-model-predictive-control-synthesis is an attempt to implement the ideas laid out in the paper Lu, J., D. Li and Y. Xi (2013). "Constrained model predictive control synthesis for uncertain discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems." IET Control Theory & Applications 7(5): 707-719. See [(Lu et al, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-cta.2012.0884).

A matlab code is provided that uses [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io) with [sedumi](https://github.com/SQLP/SeDuMi) or [mosek](http://www.mosek.com). It is assumed that all the necessary packages are already installed in the MATLAB environment. If not you can uncomment a few lines in the main script and change them accordingly.


# The MATLAB mfiles

## The main script

The main script is the file "Example_Constrained".

Just type the name after the prompt and the script will take care of running the example given in the paper.

Please remember to set the path for yalmip, sedumi or mosek before calling it. In the script you will find the following lines:

addpath(genpath('~/Documents/MATLAB/yalmip'))

addpath(genpath('~/Documents/MATLAB/cvx/sedumi'))

addpath(genpath('~/Documents/MATLAB/cvx/sdpt3'))

addpath(genpath('~/mosek/8/toolbox/r2014a'));

Please change them accordingly.

In the script you will find the following main flags: 

1) flagx - if flagx = 0, the initial conditions for the states x are always 1, that is, x(:,1)=[1;1].  If flagx = 1, the initial conditions are chosen randomly from an uniform distribution U(-1,1).  The default is flagx=0.

2) flagu - if flagu = 0, the initial condition for the input is always the value of the variable CIu (CIu=0.22 is the default).  If flagu = 1, the initial condition is randomly chosen from an uniform distribution U(-umax,umax) where umax is 1 as for the example in the paper. The default is flagu=0; 

3) flagr - if flagr = 0, the initial mode is set to 1 (as in the paper).  If flagr = 1, the initial model is randomly chosen from the set {1,2,3}. 

The main parameters are:

* The number of replication is set to 100. If there is a need to change the value, use the variable nrep in the beginning of the script.

* The maximum input value is set to 1 using the variable umax.  

* The number of steps in each replication (simulation) is set using the variable ksteps.  The default is ksteps = 80 (as in the paper).

* There is a flag, flagc, that if it is set to 1 the constrained problem will be solved otherwise an unconstrained problem will be solved instead.  

* The prediction control estrategy can be controlled using the variable N in the main script.  The default is N = 1.

A couple of observations:

Obs. 1: I have not included the state constraints.

Obs. 2: As it is the code fails for some initial conditions.  Despite the problem I hope it will be of some help to anyone who wants to understand the problem discussed in the paper.

Obs. 3: As it is the code is set to run using mosek instead of sedumi.   

Obs. 4: I thank Dr. Lu for patiently answering my questions.  

## Some useful information

All the LMIs are coded using a string variable which is later converted to LMIs.  For instance if the content of LMI 21 needs to be checked, just issue the following command after the matlab prompt

`>> auxm21`

and you will see

auxm21 =

  2Ã—2 cell array

    'G(:,:,n,i)'+G(:,:,n,i)-mathW(:,: ...'    '(A{l,i}*G(:,:,n,i)+B{l,i}*Y(:,:, ...'
    '(A{l,i}*G(:,:,n,i)+B{l,i}*Y(:,:, ...'    'mathW(:,:,min(N,n+1),j);'          

The sdpvar version of the same LMI can be found in the variable called m21 which is a cell array. LMI 21 is pilled up in the variable called biglmi21 that together with all other LMIs (biglmi11, biglmi15, ...) results in a single big LMI - LMIs_orig (procedure_jianbo_esp.m)

The same rationale is used for all other LMIs, that is, LMI 11, LMI 15, LM 16, LMI 20, LMI 21, LMI 23, LMI 25 (two parts)

The m-files are commented as much as possible.

If you find any mistake please let me know.  Thanks.

Here it is an example of runing the script using the default values.

* State, input and mode paths for the last replication (simulation) - ![path](images/image1.png)

* Control Cost over all replications (simulations) - ![control](images/image2.png)

* Average Control effort over all replications (simulations) - ![average](images/image7.png)
